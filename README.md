## Description

If you need to store important personal or financial information online or on your computer, it's essential that you pair your devices and accounts with strong passwords that will hold up to hacking attempts. Even though you can create lengthy and strong passwords without any assistance, attempting to identify the perfect password on your own and for each account that you create can be a time-consuming and strenuous process. The Password Generator instantly generates a random password (therefore, making it secure and very difficult for hackers to guess!) based on user-selected criteria.

The Password Generator features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript. It also features a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
